# 32 Bit Register

## Introduction
This is a 32 bit singular register for my CPU. It has 5 bits to address the register (5 for store enable, 5 for output enable) and a sixth one, which should only be used if necessary.
Multiple registers can be connected on top of each other.


## More info
**Please note that the register is untested and functionality can't be guaranteed.**

More info is available in the datasheet PDF.
